The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations in CSS, but sometimes unexpected results may occur due to incorrect usage or interactions with other CSS properties.  For example, using `calc()` with percentages can lead to unexpected outcomes if not handled carefully.  Another issue is using `calc()` with units inconsistently. 

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 50px);
  /* Correct usage */
  height: calc(100% - 50px); /* Correct usage */
  margin: calc(10% - 10px); /* Inconsistent units: may lead to unexpected results */
}
```
